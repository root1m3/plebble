directory data contains the master files for the API spec.

produces two APIs, one correcponding to the gov process (dgrams via 16672) and the other correxponding to the wallet.process (datagrams via port 16673).

Function have auto generated consecutive and non-spaced service id numbers (svc_t)
The reason for this is because the datagram routing is based on svc intervals.

The api indexes are left on files:
  generated/gov/svc_v3
  generated/wallet/svc_v3

These files must be copied to:
  svcnet/gov
  svcnet/wallet
respectively after every network upgrade. Files in svcnet directory represent the API nodes are running out there.

Inserting new functions or deleting will change all svc after it, that would produce incompatibility between consecutive api version for all that functions.
A map translating svc between current and previous is computed by this algorithm and left on the files:

generated/gov/c++/svc_from_prev_v
generated/gov/c++/svc_to_prev_v
generated/wallet/c++/svc_from_prev_v
generated/wallet/c++/svc_to_prev_v

The code includes them, in order to handle conversations between nodes with different api_ver numbers seamlessly using a svcfish translator initialized with this mapping files.

IMPORTANT the task of 
cp generated/gov/svc_v? svcnet/gov
cp generated/wallet/svc_v? svcnet/wallet
where ? is the version number generated for the api

the current and prev version numbers can be found in the files:
generated/gov/svc_prev_v
generated/gov/svc_cur_v
generated/wallet/svc_prev_v
generated/wallet/svc_cur_v

Please don't rename functions. They are trated as a deletion plus an adition and can cause old nodes to reject the datagram.
