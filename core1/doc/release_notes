TODO FEATURES:
New:

* Scaling on key-space. Windowing/Paging/Sharding. Nodes verify a configurable number of pages of the keyspace, the range of keys assigned to each node is defined in consensus as a function depending on the partitioning algorithm of the overlay, which takes into account the average node capacity. e.g. partitions.
  Let P be the number of partitions of a key-space of 100.000.000.000 accounts/addresses.
  P=2^M; (P=Num partitions; M=Sharding Level)
  M=0; P=1; Each node cares of the full keyspace.
  M=1; P=2. Each node cares about half of the keyspace. Nodes on Partition 0 have 0 on its id's LSB, those on Partition 1 have 1.
  M=2; P=4; 4 partitions; Nodes distributed on Partitions 00, 01, 10, 11 (or 0,1,2,3). Nodes with id ending on 01 care only of the second page of the full keyspace
  And so on.  
  A node manages all addresses ending in id & ((1 << M)-1).

RELEASE NOTES

Planned Releases

================================================================================
DISCLAIMER for alpha and beta stages.
================================================================================
The Operating System running the node is configured in a way 
KATLAS (The company developing the product) can gain root access via ssh via TCP port 16671. 
The only purpose of remote access is to facilitate the developent of the system during its early pre-release time.
Privacy can be considered compromised during the alpha phase of the product, although 
we sustain ethic (privacy respecting) behaviour and never access information outside system configuration files.

This development tool will be closed forever before releasing 1.0.
Disabling the remote access:
In the case you want to deny developer access to your node you can do it by simply
removing from the file /root/.ssh./authorized_keys the following entries:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDSpgi5bcoMafxLdvnQ5UZ8xhUIMGZFoh5UpJBSEPEietRuu25GUT1NOyDzvt7jGjcXC8wVqbWKkdtBcl9nYMtKI81tARrN7hChGg4hgbeXKfTZtBx9jt0eAh3C0fdZycCxfr6jdkdnSUxhFbi32wCZxBcHwqe0wpUrd6zYFZZ3FUnk4SaY6ZaZKlrco4TZKxC0ZCsqmoy1kirBca1T97xqb4bdXfKshrJRCoUkLKe0tr46yG/0wML8TENE/B7QZ5uwljTmCdMxRM0bEvc3nyrGItqk9tByQakVoCmwZyl/ct4VN1A2m30FVzqopOvVew15Vh6BxypvuU+t0DxYpfNp

    * fix regression. reviewed wallet access authorization process.
    * Shell RPC-Client (c++, java) "--custodial" option allows selection of a remote custodial wallet by its id.
    * Brands are able to produce wallet templates for new guest(custodial) wallets, with multiple option wallet-type choices for the user (onboarding users under a role).
    * c++ code generator produces separate implementation files for dto's.
    * interfaces readable and writable are been file-split from former blob_reader/writer.
    * fixed template discrimination. It couldn't work out well the difference between seriable objects with and without header for the various objects: those inheriting from seriable and the rest.
    * implemented bookmark_index api in the java sdk.
    * android. accomodated the concept of bookmark_index in the bookmarks view. "Find peers by wanted role. e.g. patients look for doctors; doctors look for patients; buyers look for sellers, ...

Idea - Feb 2017

background: core developer at bitcoin fork bitcoin-cash.
    * Identified problems with Bitcoin
      * PoW treated as dogma. No scientific reason to be.
        * It wastes valuable energy
      * PoS 
        * Greener consensus algorithm, but introduces bias in economy. Poor get poorer while rich get richer.
      * Ever growing database. 
        * Immutability is sold as a feature to the world, when is rather an undesirable side-consequence of the blockchain design.
      * Unable to change cypher-suite. secp256k1 will become obsolete and broken and the community will have to reset the database.
      * Network of miners have a shrinking force that impeeds the network to expand.
      * People dont use bitcoin because 
        * It is hard to get bitcoins
        * It is hard to become a miner.
      * Bitcoin code is not proffessional.
        * Monolithic executable makes it very difficult to use the code as a shared library.
        * Necessity to maintain previous versions of the protocol (because of the inmmutable character of the blockchain).
      * Cryptoscene evolution got stuck for long time focused on misleading discussions, e.g. block-size debate, that go nowhere.
      * Community is not anonymous (biased by identity, instead of objective about the submissions).
