P2P-Law Demonstrator:
    Classic Law.

    Every node has its own laws, represented by a list of paragraphs.
    They shall compare 2 laws and extract one common law they can agree upon.
    Enrich your own Law incorporating articles you'd like to endorse.
    Provides the best contextual information for conducting interactions.
    In Augmentated Reality it could be represented as a HUD Display for the users-user specialized automation)
    Articles can be tied to algorithms transforming evidences into a veredict.
    You could run in private a judge. A judge is a program taking as input:
            your evidences (assume envidences are sequence of bits meaning a cryptographic proof of some fact) ), 
            law (list of articles)
    producing as a result a veredict, like an economic saction/award could be.

    When a wallet starts a trade with other wallet, execute the law2law protocol. It will follow the sequence:
        1- Exchange laws
        2- Merge and agree into 1 law
        3- Exchange known judges (remember judges are algorithms).
        4- Agree on a judge. It could imply to run every judge with your facts and the agreed law, and try to agree on the one that is more convenient or having good veredicts.
        5- From now on parties promise to obey the judge. If one refuses to obey the other can create a public proof of the offence that could end up affecting current or future trades the perpetrator could do using the same personality.

The negotiation stage is an agreement on a common Law and a common judge.
    With this agreement in place 

    The Hypertrade provides
        
    

Compilant under ANY Law:

    * Law systems guaranteeing the following Rights for an individual for electronic communications:
        * Right to stay anonymous and being able to securely communicate with anyone in privacy.
        * Right to create coins and control their mint (printing/burning capability)
        * Right to acquire good/services in private using other's money.
        * Right to give good/services using self-money as payment coin (previously printed and distributed)
        * Right to be sovereign. Being free to choose between subverting to authority or none.
        * Right to negotiate rights. Eg. accepting safety in exchange of privacy guarantees.

    * More restrictive Laws.
        Under more strict Law systems the system can easily be forked for developing a compilancy-patch.
        (e.g. An hypothetical law requiring to run a periodic function disclosing to the government taxoffice your financial details)
